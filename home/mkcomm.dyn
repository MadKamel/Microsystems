@MK-COMMS is an IRC-based network that connects services together. This allows for file transfers and a simple message sharing system. Here are some basic commands to help get you started on MK-COMMS:

  1. mk-ping
    This command probes for active services. It will
      show you every service it finds in brackets.

  2. mk-rqst [target] get [filename]
     -[target] is the service you want to connect to.
     -[filename] is the file you want to request.
    This command requests a service for a file.

Public file services usually have a 'sitemap' file.
Try requesting one from an open service.

Please note: It takes a few moments after logging in for the IRC connection to finish, so you'll be offline for a couple seconds.
