# Microsystems
This is a project I started a year ago just for fun. It's a mock command-line Operating System written in Python. You can run it at its Repl.IT website linked below.

I also linked this program with my MK-COMMS network. It enables data to move between different services via IRC. There is a starter's guide you can run by entering the command run 'mkcomm.dyn' to get you started on using it.
